/// / A ring is a set R equipped with two binary operations[1] + and · satisfying the following three sets of axioms, called the ring axioms[2][3][4]
/// /
/// /1. R is an abelian group under addition, meaning that:
/// /
/// /(a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for all a, b, c in R   (that is, + is associative).
/// /    a + b = b + a for all a, b in R   (that is, + is commutative).
/// /There is an element 0 in R such that a + 0 = a for all a in R   (that is, 0 is the additive identity).
/// /For each a in R there exists −a in R such that a + (−a) = 0   (that is, −a is the additive inverse of a).
/// /
/// /2. R is a monoid under multiplication, meaning that:
/// /
/// /(a · b) · c = a · (b · c) for all a, b, c in R   (that is, · is associative).
/// /    There is an element 1 in R such that a · 1 = a and 1 · a = a for all a in R   (that is, 1 is the multiplicative identity).[5]
/// /
/// /3. Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition:
/// /
/// /a ⋅ (b + c) = (a · b) + (a · c) for all a, b, c in R   (left distributivity).
/// /    (b + c) · a = (b · a) + (c · a) for all a, b, c in R   (right distributivity).
/// /
